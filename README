* XFWM4 Menu and Session Icons automatisation for XFWM4 (ropetry)
* Option to hide all Menu/Icons - Just Display Session Infos
* clean up old WM / Openbox as support is broken in some ways now

New:
Moved to kernel 3.6.11
Updated nvidia xorg driver and kernel module
Updated open-vm-tools

Installation:
Just run setup_chroot. The first time this is run, it will expand all binary packages into the right place.
Afterwards it will just start the chroot session.

I have done my best to limit changes to the breadth of the chroot environment. Most everything you really need is in /ts

Compiling:
The CFLAGS and CXFLAGS can be changed by editing /ts/etc/pkgmk.conf and then exiting and re-entering the chroot
If you change the flags, you might want to rebuild all installed packages with rebuild-all command.
You can make a single package like this `prt-get depinst [Package Name]` or update it with `prt-get update [Package name]`.
You can remove a package  with `prt-get remove [Package Name]`.
You can also go to the actual port directory like cd /ts/ports/components/busybox-TS and then do pkgmk -kw(keep work) if you want to 
examine the working compile and perhaps edit a .config file.
If you upgrade a version or change a .config, you will need to run pkgmk -um to update md5 checksums on source files.
If the file layout changes, you will need to run pkgmk -uf to update the footprint of the results.

Ports:
The available ports directories can be changed in /ts/etc/prt-get.conf and then exiting and re-entering chroot.
A "Generic" Pkgfile is located in /ts/ports. Copy this file into your new port directory and rename to Pkgfile.
You can update the official crux ports with ports -u and then do a prt-get sysup to update all packages in chroot.
Other ports may be availabe, but should only be used as a template from http://crux.nu/portdb/ .
Doing an update will sometimes give undesired results. Be patient and read the log files for package builds.(/var/log/pkgbuild)

Updating ThinStation:
The update command will read a .dna file and extract the latest and greatest from compressed binary packages into the 
working TS packages folder.

Source:
Some package sources were not available in any crux port. 
In those instances, I made my own port, BUT I did not install the resulting binaries into the chroot, but rather jailed them in 
/ts/components. Ports where I could not locate the source anywhere else but in the old TS chroot are in /ts/ports/static-source.
You could compile all static source packages with a line like 

for i in `ls --color=never /ts/ports/static-source/`; do prt-get install $i; done

This will also work with the components directory.


WARNING:
Never edit the ports in /usr/ports/. You will likely lose your work. 
If you need to edit a port, bring it into the /ts/ports/(something appt) directory and make your own package.

Everything else you might need is in /ts/TS_ENV
