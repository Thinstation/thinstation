# VirtualHere will make your USB device appear local and yet be connected in a remote location.
# All communication takes place transparently using a network instead of a USB cable, thereby allowing remote access to USB devices.
# There are many benefits to enabling remote access to USB devices, including not needing to have your USB device actually present near your computer,
# being able to share the device among different computers on the network or over the Internet,
# and being able to centrally manage USB devices in an office environment.
#
# You may Install the Generic Build of the VirtualHere Server on an unlimited number of computers and share a single USB device per computer server,with no payment required.
# To share more than one USB device simultaneously from a single server you must purchase an "Unlimited Device License".
