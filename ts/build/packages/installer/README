NOTE:	You will need a network connection for this installer to work. 
	Proxy's are Supported (Notes at bottom).

What will this disc do?

This disc is meant to install the build env along with the dev env into /thinstation.
It will install a bootable TS image onto the hard drive and make this workstation a 
PXE boot server

Do I really need this?

Strictly speaking, no. You can git clone on your favorite distro like this.
git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/Thinstation/thinstation.git

What else do I need?

If you want to boot clients from this workstation, you will need to assign a static ip to 
the mac address of this workstation on your DHCP Server. Then you will need to set the next
boot server for your network to that IP and set the boot file to pxelinux.0  on your DHCP
server.

How do I build a thinclient?

After the installation has finished and you have rebooted, open an xterm and do the following 
cd /thinstation
./setup-chroot
cd /build
./build

This will make a thinclient that will boot on VMware workstations.

How do I change the kind of image I want to make?

nano build.conf and thinstation.conf.buildtime.

Is there any more Documentation or Help?

Yes. Check /build/conf 
and the wiki at 

http:/www.thinstation.org

https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/thinstation-general

(PROXY SUPPORT)

The sourceforge.net git repo does not support http or https, only ssh and git.
All is not lost however. You can still clone via an https proxy with a little extra configuration.
On the proxy server, you will need to allow the ssl 'CONNECT' command for port 9418.
As an example, for squid, you would edit the squid.conf and add port 9418 to the list
of ssl ports along side 443 and 563. 

If you setup a proxy, a couple of files are created in ~/  .wgetrc proxy .gitconfig
These files may contain the plain text of a username and password. You may want to delete them after installation.
