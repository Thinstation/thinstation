################################################
#
#
# This is Thinstation s basic setup file. In this file you decide which
# hardware, programs and features to be included in the Thinstation
# boot image generated by running "./build".
#
# You can customize/limit the possibilities in the thinstation.conf
# files later.
#
# Anything after a "#" is a comment. You activate "things" by removing
# the "#" and remove "things" by putting a "#" in front of them.
#
# First we define which modules to include. Modules are hardware
# drivers. NEVER include more than necessary - the more modules, the
# longer boot time.

### --- Machine Modules to include in boot image --- ###
########################################################
# A machine profile is a set of modules for a specific set of hardware
# components like a thinclient with adapters. It does not include any
# filesystem modules, those need to be selected individualy. Making a
# a machine profile is a two step process. First you will need to make
# an allmodules build like "./build --allmodules" with the extensions-x
# package included. Once the client machine is booted with that image
# you can open and xterm or telnet in and run "hwlister.sh". hwlister.sh
# will compile some lists and attempt to post them to the pxe server assigned
# to the client. If the pxe server is this workstation and you are hosting
# files directly out of this build env, you can then run
# "./mkmachine SOME-MODEL" and the files will be put into the machine folder
# under that model name. Now all you have to do is add a line to this file
# like "machine SOME-MODEL" and you will no longer have to make
# allmodules builds. If this is not the pxe server, you will have to
# move stuff around on your own, but the most important files are
# modules.list and firmware.list.

### --- Modules to include in boot image --- ###
################################################
# Any modules may be added as "module" or "module_pkg".
# If defined as a "module", the driver is included in the boot image.
# If defined as a "module_pkg", the driver is added from outside the
# image, such as from a tftp server.  See note below for more details.
#
# Normally you should use "module".  Only use "module_pkg" if you want
# to dynamically load modules.
# Note: If you create a module_pkg network driver, and decide to load it
#       from a tftp server, it won t work.  This is because the image
#       won t have a network driver to get the module_pkg in the first
#       place.
