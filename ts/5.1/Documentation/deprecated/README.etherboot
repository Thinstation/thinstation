To use Etherboot:

    1. Copy "thinstation.nbi" and "thinstation.conf.network" to the root directory of the TFTP server.
    2. Edit "thinstation.conf.network" to match your terminals configuration ("thinstation.conf.network" 
       is a copy of "thinstation.conf.example"). You may have individual config files for each terminal.
       See the FAQ for details (http://thinstation.sf.net/faq.html).    
    3. Add the filename "thinstation.nbi" to your DHCP servers configuration file.
    4. Boot your terminal.
