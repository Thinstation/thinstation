Bugs
====
1. Workspaces in blackbox and icewm don't work all the time.
2. Starting multiple window manager sessions (i.e. blackbox) with dual
   head support may cause some problems with menu items.
3. Second X session in dual head mode goes into a screen saver state
   after a while, which corrupts the session.
4. Problem with PKG files which have a rc0 script, they won't be picked
   up when booting.  Problem is with thinstation.init script, doesn't
   refresh initlist file while using (cat & while) loop.
