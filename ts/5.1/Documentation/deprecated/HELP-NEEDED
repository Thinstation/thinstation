Help Needed
===========

Hi,

There are a few things I would like to do in Thinstation, which I don't
have the neccesary skills for.  If anyone can give me a hand with the
following, let me know:

1. Major Work:
   Convert svga-rdesktop patch to work with rdesktop 1.4.1.  You'll need
   serious C programming skills.

2. Minor Work:
   Fix busybox httpd so it works with POST pages in IE.  Currently works
   with firebird.

3. Minor Work
   Fix mdetect so it works with newer mice (haven't confirmed this, but
   there seems to be some problems with it picking up some USB mice
   with a PS2 convertor on them).

You can contact me via the sourceforge page at
thinstation.sourceforge.net.

Cheers,

Miles
