To boot Thinstation from a DOS or Windows 95/98/ME partition (NTFS is not supported, only FAT):

    1. Copy "ts.bat", "loadlin.exe", "initrd" & "vmlinuz" to a directory on your hard-drive.
    2. If you have set the STORAGE_PATH option in "thinstation.conf.buildtime", put a
       "thinstation.conf.user" on the harddisk as "STORAGE_PATH/thinstation.profile/thinstation.conf.user"
       ("thinstation.conf.user" is a copy of "thinstation.conf.example").
       Otherwise defaults set in "thinstation.conf.buildtime" will be used.
    3. Run "ts.bat" to start Thinstation. You may call "ts.bat" from "autoexec.bat".
