Note that wine compiles twice for 32bit and 64bit use and as such
requires compat-32 ports tree to be enabled to work.

You could edit wine to only compile 64bit only but then you can
only run PE64 bit binaries.

You enable compat-32 by.

mv /etc/ports/compat-32.rsync.inactive /etc/ports/compat-32.rsync

$EDITOR /etc/prt-get.conf

And uncomment:

prtdir /usr/ports/compat-32

Also be sure to enable:

runscripts yes

To speed up building wine multiple times also:

prt-get depinst gcc48-ccache-bindings

And configure ccache https://crux.nu/Wiki/HowToSpeedUpBuildingPackages#ccache
