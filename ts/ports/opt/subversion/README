NOTES

This is a port for the subversion revision control; if you have apache
(version 2.0+) installed, you'll also get the apache modules to run a
subversion server via apache/WebDAV.
Else you'll still be able to create a server with the svnserve
application. If you want absolutely no server parts, add
"--without-berkeley-db" to the configure line

If you're going to install apache later on, you'll need to recompile
this package (solutions to this are already planned).

If you want Python Bindings, install SWIG and comment out the few lines
in the build() function

PRE-INSTALL (SERVER)
Make sure you install expat before you install apache; also, note that you'll
get a footprint missmatch


POST-INSTALL (SERVER)

add something like this to your apache configuration:

#LoadModule dav_module         lib/apache/mod_dav.so
#LoadModule dav_svn_module     lib/apache/mod_dav_svn.so
#<Location /svn/repos>
#   DAV svn
#   SVNPath /home/svnroot
#
#   # Limit write permission to list of valid users.
#   <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
#      # Require SSL connection for password protection.
#      # SSLRequireSSL
#
#      AuthType Basic
#      AuthName "Authorization Realm"
#      AuthUserFile /absolute/path/to/passwdfile
#      Require valid-user
#   </LimitExcept>
#</Location>
