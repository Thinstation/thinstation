NOTE:

Some people have reported problems when using optimizations larger than
-O2; typical symptoms are "prt-get install X" saying that a package is
installed while "prt-get update X" saying it's not, or "prt-get listinst"
printing just nothing.

If you experience strange effects, please try recompiling with 
   CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=x86-64 -pipe"
